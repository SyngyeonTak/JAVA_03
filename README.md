Java Type Casting. Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.<br>
In Java, there are two types of casting: Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size.
* Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size<br>
  byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

* Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type<br>
  double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte
